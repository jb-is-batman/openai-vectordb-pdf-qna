# OpenAI PDF Chat

## Description
"OpenAI PDF Chat" is a Python-based terminal application designed to facilitate advanced document analysis and querying capabilities. The core functionality of the application revolves around processing PDF documents, extracting text, and leveraging the power of OpenAI's models to generate meaningful embeddings from the extracted text.

### Key Features and Workflow:
**1. Document Upload and Text Extraction:**
 - The program begins by uploading a PDF document (pdf_path = './example.pdf') through the ingest.py file.
 - The text extraction process involves breaking down the document into defined character chunks. This ensures a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the documentâ€™s content.

**2. Intelligent Text Chunking:**
  - A crucial aspect of the extraction process is the intelligent chunking of text. The application ensures that each chunk extends to the end of a word, especially when a word falls in the middle of a chunk boundary. This feature preserves the integrity and context of the text being analyzed.

**3. Text Embedding Using OpenAI Models:**
  - Once the text is extracted and chunked, the application utilizes OpenAI's advanced models to create embeddings from these text chunks. These embeddings capture the semantic essence of the text, enabling deeper and more contextual analysis.

**4. Integration with Pinecone Vector Database:**
  - The generated embeddings, along with the original text and its corresponding page number, are stored in a Pinecone vector database. This integration facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of information, making it ideal for applications requiring fast and accurate text search and analysis.
